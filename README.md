# MediaPlayer_Java

In this project the mediaplayer plays the video chosen. The mediaplayer is written in Java. The project also has implementation of face tracking using the haarcascade(registered to Intel usage prohibited for commercial purposes) using opencv. The player sort of plays and pauses based on if anyone is looking towards the webcamera. The player has a problem of jaggedness as the player checks for face every second as both of them are not syncronized well. Maybe fixing that will be the next thing to do in this project.
